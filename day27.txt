I did't solve any questions today though but I did learn about permutation it seems kind of difficult and i wasn't able
to clear it so that's why i didn't code today. I won't say that, today I didn't do anything productive 
cause learning Permutation is also important for the interview perspective anyways I'm gonna update this to  github too 
because I don't wanna miss my Github Streak lol see u tommorrow with some more productivity ;)
